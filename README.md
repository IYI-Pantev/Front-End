# JavaScript, React, and Node.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning journey! This repository is where I document my progress as I dive deeper into JavaScript, React, and Node.js. My goal is to enhance my skills as a full-stack developer by building projects and experimenting with these technologies.

## Technologies

- **JavaScript**: The core of modern web development, used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on component-based development and state management.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows me to run JavaScript on the server, enabling me to build full-stack applications using JavaScript alone.

## Projects

- **JavaScript Basics**: Exploring fundamental concepts like variables, functions, and control structures.
- **React Components**: Learning to build reusable UI components and manage application state.
- **Node.js APIs**: Creating RESTful APIs, working with Express, and connecting to databases.

## Goals

- Master JavaScript ES6+ features.
- Build complex, real-world applications using React.
- Develop backend services with Node.js and Express.
- Implement full-stack projects that integrate frontend and backend.
